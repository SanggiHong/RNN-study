# Machine learing, RNN model study
For more clear understanding.  
The model to recognize the string sequence 'hihello'.  
  
with\_provided.py file is with [https://hunkim.github.io/ml/](https://hunkim.github.io/ml/ "Machine Learing for everyone")  
  
manual.py file is the code for the vanilla RNN model implemented manually with tensorflow.  
(of course there is no implement for gradient descent, only the loose model)
